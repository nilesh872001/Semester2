She personally showed us the room to ensure we were happy with it and we were. She was also very helpful in recommending local shows and attractions. Thank you Jennifer!\",\n          \"I had read the reviews of Affinia Gardens which were good, but really wasnt sure what to expect. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! First of all the room was immaculate. I am a little fussy when it comes to cleanliness, and this place was spotless. There were four ladies sharing a room (recipe for distaster right) But the room had different areas such as a makeup area and a separate mirror near the bathroom. The kitchenette was wonderful for having a bagel and coffee before we left for our classes. The only reason I didn't rank a five for location is because you have to take a cab to Times Square. Other than that, this place was a real gem.\",\n          \"My new husband and I stayed at this hotel -th November for -nights. I booked this hotel (direct) based on the very reasonable room rate for NYC and excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We arrived by yellow cab and were greeted by such lovely and welcoming staff. I had advised upon booking (almost a year before departing) that it would be our honey moon. They had very kindly upgraded us from a lower floor queen room to a superior on the highest floor possible (--). A view of the Empire State Building to the left and a view of the Hudson to the right. Perfect. Reception also sent up a couple of cupcakes to our room with a note they had written offering their congratulations. What is lovely about this hotel is that there are only - rooms per floor and only those rooms can access your floor in the lift by swiping the door key in the lift. So there isn't a constant flow of people coming and going to their rooms or being noisy etc etc. Our room was nicely decorated and we had enough room. The bathroom was very modern and we had a lovely shower. The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all. I really loved the feeling of this boutique style hotel and loved the fact that it is a bit of an undiscovered gem. I will always recommend this hotel for NYC.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Browser_Used\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Google Chrome\",\n          \"Edge\",\n          \"Mozilla Firefox\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Device_Used\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mobile\",\n          \"Tablet\",\n          \"Desktop\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Is_Response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"happy\",\n          \"not happy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Reviewdata.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4vszSj9JGTsx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712922264999,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"506_Siddhant Singh Chauhan","userId":"16853132131498276314"}},"outputId":"f35b88f2-14d5-48cb-ade0-e39b91c53507"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 38932 entries, 0 to 38931\n","Data columns (total 5 columns):\n"," #

I booked this hotel (direct) based on the very reasonable room rate for NYC and excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We arrived by yellow cab and were greeted by such lovely and welcoming staff. I had advised upon booking (almost a year before departing) that it would be our honey moon. They had very kindly upgraded us from a lower floor queen room to a superior on the highest floor possible (--). A view of the Empire State Building to the left and a view of the Hudson to the right. Perfect. Reception also sent up a couple of cupcakes to our room with a note they had written offering their congratulations. What is lovely about this hotel is that there are only - rooms per floor and only those rooms can access your floor in the lift by swiping the door key in the lift. So there isn't a constant flow of people coming and going to their rooms or being noisy etc etc. Our room was nicely decorated and we had enough room. The bathroom was very modern and we had a lovely shower. The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all. I really loved the feeling of this boutique style hotel and loved the fact that it is a bit of an undiscovered gem.

I booked this hotel (direct) based on the very reasonable room rate for NYC and excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We arrived by yellow cab and were greeted by such lovely and welcoming staff. I had advised upon booking (almost a year before departing) that it would be our honey moon. They had very kindly upgraded us from a lower floor queen room to a superior on the highest floor possible (--). A view of the Empire State Building to the left and a view of the Hudson to the right. Perfect. Reception also sent up a couple of cupcakes to our room with a note they had written offering their congratulations. What is lovely about this hotel is that there are only - rooms per floor and only those rooms can access your floor in the lift by swiping the door key in the lift. So there isn't a constant flow of people coming and going to their rooms or being noisy etc etc. Our room was nicely decorated and we had enough room. The bathroom was very modern and we had a lovely shower. The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all. I really loved the feeling of this boutique style hotel and loved the fact that it is a bit of an undiscovered gem. I will always recommend this hotel for NYC.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Is_Response\",\n

the room had different areas such as a makeup area and a separate mirror near the bathroom. the kitchenette was wonderful for having a bagel and coffee before we left for our classes. the only reason i didn't rank a five for location is because you have to take a cab to times square. other than that, this place was a real gem.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
